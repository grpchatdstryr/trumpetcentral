# Needed Accessories
There are only a few needed accessories for the trumpet. Most involve cleaning. With the trumpet, of course you will need a mouthpiece. It is recommended to buy a Bach 7C mouthpiece to start out. As you progress, you could opt for a 5c, or even a 3C, like I have. 

Now that you have a trumpet and a mouthpiece, you can technically play the trumpet. Trumpet. However, you still need the cleaning supplies and other things to keep your trumpet clean and functional. 

### Cleaning Accessories
- Valve brush
- Cleaning snake
- Mouthpiece brush
- Microfiber cloth

- Value oil
- Slide grease

Maintenance is a core part of keeping your trumpet working properly. Without in it, it will become less efficient and cause you problems down the line and potentially money. The [next page](proper-maintenance.md) talks about proper maintenance.
