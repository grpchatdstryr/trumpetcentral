### #1 - Oil Your Values

So around 5, 5 to 10 hours of playing, you should oil your valves around that time frame. You might think that's Overkill, but proper oil. Make sure it doesn't wear away your valves. 

### #2 - Bathe Your Trumpet Regularly 
Giving your trumpet a bath and fully cleaning it out is beneficial for cleaning everything out of it as well as gives your mind a sense of peace. You should do this fairly regularly as it cleans out everything, making sure you have a consistent sound, removes little bits of crud, and maybe even some food you ate last week. Beware, you will likely be disgusted and what comes out of it, especially after not cleaning it in a while. 

### #3 - Use Slide Grease
Especially after giving your trumpet a bath, using slide grease. Make sure that one your slides don't stick and freeze, having to go to a repair shop. Third valve slide for certain notes that tend sharp, staying in tune. To grease your slides nearly as much as valve oil.

### #4 - Wipe Your Trumpet Down Regularly
