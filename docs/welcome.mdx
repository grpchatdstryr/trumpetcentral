# Welcome 

### Welcome to the Trumpet! 🎺
In this section, you will find everything you need to know about what it takes to get started with the trumpet, other resources in general, and much more. I'll cover the trumpet in general, best practice methods, solid resources, the accessories, every trumpet, player needs, and proper maintenance. And much more. This site should allow you to get a better understanding of what you need to know, give you access to resources like no other site, and hopefully inspire you. 

### *What That Means...*
This website is dedicated to helping others get started, providing essential resource to all trumpet players. My hope is to inspire people to get more involved with the instrument. I have 5,000+ hours of experience with the trumpet and don't want to let that go to waste. I love helping others, especially if I am knowledgeable about the subject. Additionally, to those hours, I have 4,000+ hours, the tech field, and 1,000+ hours in the creative arts Field. That's over 10,000 hours. I want to use that help people with their journey, bring passion around the instrument as I have passion for it, give back as my private instructors and others poured into me, all free of charge. Hope you enjoy. 💛
