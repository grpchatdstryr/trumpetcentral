## About the Project
This project is combining 10,000+ hours of experience to build something cool! I have spent 5,000+ hours with the trumpet, 4,000+ hours in the tech field, and 1,000+ hours in the creative arts field: total of 10,000 hours. Have been thinking about this project for quite some time. Created the YouTube channel back in 2021, uploaded a couple videos (now unlisted), but then went to college. After graduating, I finally have the time, more experience, and motivation to work on this project. Looking forward to seeing where it leads! Hope you enjoy. 💛
