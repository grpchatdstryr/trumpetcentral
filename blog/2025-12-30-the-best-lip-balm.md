# Best Lip Balm for Trumpet Players

My lips are notoriously dry and chapped. Even in the summer time I use lip balm. When winter time comes around, my lips feel like sandpaper. There's been one lip balm that has worked very well with my trumpet playing. The brand is called [ChopSaver](https://www.chopsaver.com/). The guy who made it is a professional trumpet player who designed the product specifically for trumpet players. 

While honestly it is kind of overpriced for lip balm, it does work well using it while playing the trumpet. For other trumpet players with extremely dry lips like me, could be worth looking into.

*I am not sponsored by them in any way, shape or form, just have used their product and liked it.*
